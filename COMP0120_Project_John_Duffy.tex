\section{Introduction}

Suppose we have been provided with a dataset $L$ consisting of $N$ elements, each with a $x_0$ and $x_1$ value. Furthermore, suppose we have been provided with a vector $y$ of length $N$ consisting of the values $a$ and $b$, where each index of $y$ corresponds to the same index of $L$. So, each element of $L$ has an associated value $a$ or $b$ in $y$.

We could plot the elements of $L$ as per Figure 1. Clearly, the elements with the value $a$ are clustered together, as are those with the value $b$, without overlap. The elements are $linearly$  $separable$.

Now suppose we wish to draw a line $l$ between the two clusters, such that additional elements without a known value can be accurately classified as being of value $a$ or $b$. This process is called \emph{linear binary classification}; \emph{linear} because we wish to separate the classes (the clusters of values $a$ and $b$) with a line, and \emph{binary} because we have two classes. This process can be extended to be $non-linear$, i.e. use a higher degree polynomial to separate the classes, and to include additional classes.  

Implementing this process using a method called Support Vector Machines (SVMs), first conceived of by Cortes and Vapnik [1], is the subject of this report.

\section{Mathematical Setting}

\subsection{Binary Classification}

How should we decide where to draw the line $l$? Consider Figure 2. If we used the line $l_1$ then additional elements of Class $a$ may be incorrectly classified as Class $b$. Conversely, if we used the line $l_2$ then additional elements of Class $b$ may be incorrectly classified as Class $a$.

SVMs provide a method of deciding how to draw the line $l$ (and higher degree polynomials in the non-linear case) to provide accurate classification. SVMs maximise the width $W$ of the "street" between classes, as depicted in Figure 3.
